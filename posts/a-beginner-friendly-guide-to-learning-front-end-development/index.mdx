Learning the skills needed to become a **Front-End Developer** can often be confusing and time-intensive.
If you don't know where to start and are confused about what to **focus your time and energy on**, here are some of the **languages, frameworks and tools** to help guide you through the maze of technology.

<h1>What skills should I learn first?</h1>

As a Front-End Developer you create **Graphical User Interfaces (GUI)** or simply **User Interfaces (UI)** such as websites, smartphone apps and web apps.
A great way to start learning front-end development is by creating your own website which you don't need to host publicly if you are not comfortable with that -
you can also run websites locally on your machine for practice.

To create a website you should first learn the basics of **HTML, CSS and JavaScript**:

- **HTML** allows you to create static content on your website as well as the layout and structure.

- With **CSS** you change the behaviour, style and animation of components that are placed on your website through HTML. It can also be configured to create responsive layouts based on the screen size of the device accessing the page.

- **JavaScript** allows you to add logic to your otherwise static website, such as retrieving user information, interacting with backend servers etc.

Here are a few links to tutorials that are great resources to learn these three important elements:

- [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp)

- [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_intro.asp)

- [CSS Flexbox](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp)

- [JavaScript ES5](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_es5.asp)

- [JavaScript ES6](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_es6.asp) - lots of changes have been made in the more recent JavaScript ES6 version, so it makes sense to learn ES5 as well - it will help you to better understand code that has been written using JavaScript ES5 or earlier

<h2>Angular and React.JS</h2>

Once you have a better understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript you can move on to learning frameworks such as **Angular, React.JS and Vue.js** which are all **JavaScript frameworks for building web applications**.
Especially React.JS and Angular have gained much popularity over the recent years and knowing how to work with them is what many employers are looking out for.
If you're unsure whether you should learn React.JS or Angular first then I would suggest to **start with React.JS**, as Angular has a steeper learning curve.

Note: **Learning to work with React.JS will not only teach you to develop web applications but you will also be able to create phone apps using the React Native framework.**

<h2>State Management Libraries</h2>

To become confident in using the frameworks above you should also learn about **state management** as it will simplify the way you deal with states in an application.

<ExampleHeading>Examples for possible states in a web application:</ExampleHeading>

- Imagine a Sliding Banner component that changes its displayed image every 3
  seconds. A reasonable state for the component would be the latest image
  displayed.

- Or imagine a Facebook Like Button - its current state could be the number of
  likes collected so far.

- Or imagine a Google Search Bar - its current state could be the latest letters
  typed in and so on...

As you can probably tell there can be countless states in a single application which can become overwhelming especially if some states need to be accessed and mutated
by several components.

There are several available libraries that combat the overwhelming nature of state management in different ways - for instance **Redux for React (NgRx is the Angular equivalent)** stores
all application states centrally and a single (or several) component(s) can choose to access any subset of the current state it needs.

With **React Hooks**, on the other hand, you are able to declare states that only belong to a single component and are therefore invisible to any other component.
Each pattern has its advantages and disadvantages and choosing the right one depends on the type of application you are developing.

Here are some useful resources to handle state management in React and Angular:

- [Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/introduction/basic-tutorial)

- [NgRx](https://stackabuse.com/beginners-guide-to-ngrx-and-angular/)

- [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)

- etc.

<h2>CSS Frameworks</h2>

CSS Frameworks such as [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/) or [MaterialUI](https://material-ui.com/getting-started/installation/) can vastly
simplify a developers life. They allow you to create **responsive layouts** (read about [CSS Flexbox here](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp) if you are wondering how you can make
responsive layouts from scratch) and they also come pre-configured with default styling for many standard components such as buttons, navigation bars and page forms.

<h1>What else do I need to know?</h1>

The **tools, frameworks and libraries** you will need to create a JavaScript application (e.g. React.JS, Angular, Bootstrap etc.) are accessible through a **package manager**, i.e.
**Node Package Manager (npm) or Yarn**. There are a few performance differences between the two package managers - in general **Yarn achieves better performance speed** as it can install multiple
packages simultaneously but **npm has a slight advantage over security concerns** - it remains down to your preference and style which one to choose.

In order to install either npm or Yarn you first need to set-up **Node.JS** which will automatically configure npm. Once installed you can install Yarn by executing `npm install --global Yarn` from the command line.

As a professional developer you will also need to know how to use a **version control system**. Version control systems, like **Git** (the most widely-used version control system), enable you
to **historically track code changes** and to **collaborate with several developers simultaneously** on a single codebase.
Therefore, if you have not come across **Git** you should become familiar with its commands and understand how it works.

Here are the most useful commands:

- `git clone <repo_url>` to download a remote repository (i.e. the link to your codebase) to your local machine.

- `git checkout <branch>` to pull an existing branch containing new features and improvements which are still in development and not ready to be used in production.

- `git checkout -b <branch>` to create a new working branch.

- `git add <files, directories etc.>` to select the files and directories to be uploaded to the remote repository.

- `git commit -m <commit message>` to save all the latest changes with a short description.

- `git push` to push your local changes to the remote repository.

- `git pull` to download the latest changes from the remote repository.

- `git merge <branch>` to merge the latest changes on your current branch with the latest changes made on another branch.

- And of course `git help` if you need help.

Git is used by many popular platforms such as **Github, Bitbucket or GitLab** - you can create a free account with any of these providers.
Here's a [Git Handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) to help you get started.

<h1>To wrap it up</h1>

Of course only reading theory has never turned a **newbie** into a **proud engineer** - what's most important is to use the skills you've learned in projects.

Here is a great tutorial on [how to create a simple To-Do App](https://www.devsurvival.com/todo-app-react-backend/) which covers the development of the web application, setting up a database and creating a backend service to retrieve and mutate data from the database.

Being able to write code in order for your application to interact with other services is another important skill a front-developer needs to have, as data
mostly originates from different sources which is made accessible through APIs.

I hope you have found these tips useful and feel ready to start developing - remember you don't need to be an expert in using any technology, as a developer you
never stop learning but knowing the basics will equip you with the needed skills to create many great applications (with the help of our best friend Google!). Best of luck!
