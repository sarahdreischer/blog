Learning the skills needed to become a Front-End Developer can often be confusing and time-intensive. If you don't know where to start and are confused about what to focus
your time and energy on, here are some of the languages, frameworks and tools to help guide you through the maze of technology.

<h1>What skills should I learn first?</h1>

As a Front-End Developer you create Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) or simply User Interfaces (UI) such as websites, smartphone apps and web apps.
A great way to start learning front-end development is by creating your own website which you don't need to host publically if you are not comfortable with that -
you can simply run websites locally on your machine for practice.

To create a website you should first learn the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript:

- HTML allows you to create content on your website as well as the layout and structure.

- With CSS you change the behaviour, style and animation of components that are placed on your website through HTML but it can also be used to dynamically size components
  based on the size of the device that accesses the page.

- JavaScript allows you to add logic to your otherwise static website, such as retrieving user information, interacting
  with backend servers etc.

Here are a few links to tutorials that are great resources to learn these three important elements:

- [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp)

- [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_intro.asp)

- [CSS Flexbox](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp)

- [JavaScript ES5](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_es5.asp)

- [JavaScript ES6](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_es6.asp) - lot's of changes have been made in the more recent JavaScript ES6 version, but it makes sense to learn ES5 as well you will better underestand how to read code that has been written with ES5 or earlier

<h2>Angular and React.JS</h2>

Once you have better understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript you can move on to learning frameworks such as Angular, React.JS and Vue.js. I will be focussing on Angular
and React as these are two frameworks I have worked with.

**Angular and React.JS** are both JavaScript frameworks for building web applications. These frameworks have gained much popularity over the recent years and are
skills that many employers look out for. If you're unsure which of these frameworks to start with then I would suggest to start with React.JS as Angular has a steeper
learning curve.

Note: _Learning to work with React.JS will not only teach you to create web applications but you will also be able to create phone apps using the React Native framework._

<h2>State Management Libraries</h2>

To become confident in using the frameworks above you should also learn about state management as they will simplify the way you deal with states in an application. If you
are not sure what states are in front-end applications, then the following example should hopefully make it clearer:

_Imagine you have a Sliding Banner component on your website. A reasonable state of the banner could be the current image it displays or if you have like button it could
be the number of likes it has collected so far or it could be the text that has been typed into a search bar and so on..._

There are several available libraries that deal with state management in different ways - for instance Redux for React or NgRx for Angular deals with all application states
being in a central place of your application and a single component can choose to access any subset of the centralised states it needs. With React Hooks for instance state
mostly belongs to components itself and cannot be accessed by other components.

Here are a few useful resources:

- [Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/introduction/basic-tutorial)

- [NgRx](https://stackabuse.com/beginners-guide-to-ngrx-and-angular/)

- [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)

<h2>CSS Libraries</h2>

CSS libraries can vastly simplify a developers life - libraries such as [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/) or
[MaterialUI](https://material-ui.com/getting-started/installation/) already come pre-configured with many aesthetically pleasing component stylings for components
as buttons, navigation bars or page forms.

Bootstrap and MaterialUI also incorporate CSS flexbox which allow you to create responsive layouts and elements based on the screen size.

<h1>What else do I need to know?</h1>

The tools and libraries you will need to create a JavaScript web application are accessible through a package manager, such as Node Package Manager (npm) or Yarn.
To get started with any advanced web application you will need to install Node.JS which will automatically install npm. Once you've got npm installed you are able to switch
to yarn (in case you feel more comfortable using that, however you can also just stick to npm as well).

With npm or yarn you will be able to install frameworks, tools and libraries (short packages) such as React, Angular, Bootstrap, Typescript etc.

As a professional developer you will also likely make use of a version control system to make your code accessible for collaboration and continual improvements.
Therefore, if you have not yet come across Git (which is the most widely-used version control system) you should learn how to work with it and make sure you become
comfortable using the command line tool for the following commands: `git clone`, `git checkout`, `git commit`, `git pull`, `git push`, `git merge`.

Git is used by many popular platforms such as Github, Bitbucket or GitLab. So kick off learning with this useful [Git Handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/)
and create your own free account on Github to track your code.

<h1>To wrap it up</h1>

Of course only reading theory has never turned a newbie into a proud engineer - what's most important is to use the skills you've learned in your own projects.
As mentioned before you could create a website or a phone app with React.JS or React Native.

Here is a great tutorial that walks you through creating a simple [To-Do App](https://material-ui.com/getting-started/installation/). It not only covers how to create the
UI but also how to interact with a database through a back-end service (don't worry - it sounds scarier than it is). Knowing how to interact with other services is another
important skill a Front-Developer needs to have as data mostly originates from different sources that is made accessible through APIs.

I hope you have found these tips useful. Thank you for reading this post and Good Luck!
