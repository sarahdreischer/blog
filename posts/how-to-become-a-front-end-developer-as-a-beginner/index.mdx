Learning the skills needed to become a Front-End Developer can often be confusing and time-intensive. If you don't know where to start and are confused about what to focus
your time and energy on, here are some of the languages, frameworks and tools to help guide you through the maze of technology.

<h1>What skills should I learn first?</h1>

Front-End Development deals with the creation of Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) such as websites, smartphone apps and web apps.

A great way to start learning front-end development is by creating your own website which you don't need to host publically if you are not comfortable with that -
you can simply run websites locally on your machine for practice.

To create a website you should first learn the basics of HTML, CSS and Javascript.

HTML allows you to create content on your website as well as the layout and structure.

With CSS you change the behaviour, style and animation of components that are placed on your website through HTML but it can also be used to dynamically size components
based on the size of the device that accesses the page.

Javascript allows you to add logic to your otherwise static website, such as retrieving user information, interacting
with backend servers etc.

Here are a few links to tutorials that are great resources to learn these three important elements:

- HTML - https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp

- CSS - https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_intro.asp

- CSS Flexbox - https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp

- Javascript ES5 - https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_es5.asp

- Javascript ES6 - https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_es6.asp --- (lot's of changes have been made in the more recent Javascript ES6 version, but it makes sense to learn ES5 as well you will better underestand how to read code that has been written with ES5 or earlier)

<h2>Angular and React.JS</h2>

Once you have better understanding of HTML, CSS and Javascript you can move on to learning frameworks such as Angular, React.JS and Vue.js. I will be focussing on Angular
and React as these are two frameworks I have worked with.

**Angular and React.JS** are both Javascript frameworks for building web applications. These frameworks have gained much popularity over the recent years and are
skills that many employers look out for. If you're unsure which of these frameworks to start with then I would suggest to start with React.JS as Angular has a steeper
learning curve.

_Note: Learning to work with React.JS will not only teach you to create web applications but you will also be able to create phone apps using the React Native framework._

<h2>State Management Libraries</h2>

To become confident in using the frameworks above you should also learn about state management as they will simplify the way you deal with states in an application. If you
are not sure what states are in front-end applications, then the following example should hopefully make it clearer:

_Imagine you have a Sliding Banner component on your website. A reasonable state of the banner could be the current image it displays or if you have like button it could
be the number of likes it has collected so far or it could be the text that has been typed into a search bar and so on..._

There are several available libraries that deal with state management in different ways - for instance Redux for React or NgRx for Angular deals with all application states
being in a central place of your application and a single component can choose to access any subset of the centralised states it needs. With React Hooks for instance state
mostly belongs to components itself and cannot be accessed by other components.

Here are a few useful resources:

- Redux - https://react-redux.js.org/introduction/basic-tutorial

- NgRx - https://stackabuse.com/beginners-guide-to-ngrx-and-angular/

- React Hooks - https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html

<h1>Project Ideas</h1>

Of course only reading theory has never turned a newbie into a proud engineer - what's most important is to use the skills you've learned in your own projects.
As mentioned before you could create a website or a phone app with React.JS or React Native.

Here are a few project ideas with tutorials:

- Create a To-Do web application - https://www.devsurvival.com/todo-app-react-backend/ --- this tutorial also covers how work with a databse and how you can interact with it throught your own Node.JS backend service with Node.JS.

<h1>What else do I need to know?</h1>

As a professional developer you always work with source countrol to make your code accessible for collaboration and continual improvements. Therefore, if you have not yet
come across this knowing how to work with git is very important.
