Becoming a Software Developer if you don't have a Computer Science degree can be confusing and time-intensive. If you're eager to get your foot in the door you there are
several options. One possible option is to join a Coding Bootcamp. This will take about 8 weeks and cost you X pounds on average. Another option is to join a company
that would hire and train you without any prior coding knowledge. But if you're lacking the time or resources to take up a Coding Bootcamp course and there's no
job in sight that doesn't require you to be a professional developer already, then learning in your own time is always a great option.

As someone who didn't study Computer Science I have been in a very similar situation - coming out of university I only knew basic Java and HTML but I have been fortunate
enough to be hired by a company that was willing to teach me all the skills needed for the job.

So here are some of the languages, frameworks and tools that I have learned to use in my first Software Development job that are used by many companies and can
help you prepare for your first job.

<h1>Frontend Technologies</h1>

<h2>Angular and React.JS</h2>

Angular and React.JS are both Javascript frameworks for building web applications. Both frameworks have gained much popularity over the recent years and are
skills that many employers look out for. If you don't have basic HTML knowledge then I would suggest that you read and try out some of the links below.

TODO - add HTML, CSS and Javascript links here

<h2>Redux and NgRx</h2>

Redux is a state management library for React - it is a design pattern that stores all states of your application in a central place (e.g. a state could be that
a checkbox is currently checked or unchecked). NgRx is the Angular equivalent of Redux.

<h2>React Hooks</h2>

React Hooks is a library in React - as the name implies. Like Redux and NgRx it is a state management library, however, Hooks can define state in a component.
Lets say you have a React component that only displays and manages a Banner on your website. The current image state of the Banner could be that it displays Image 1.
Later the image state changes to Image 2. Other components of your web application such as the Navigation Bar component don't care about the Image state of
the Banner component - therefore, it makes sense that the Banner Image state only belongs to the Banner Component and the Layout Component cannot access this state.
This is possible using Hooks.

<h1>Backend Technologies</h1>

<h2>Java 8</h2>

Java is always a good language to learn if you want to work as a Backend developer. It is used by 64,000 companies in the US alone and is the base language of
many newly written Software and legacy Software that is still being maintained. As a minimum I would suggest to learn Java 8 which contains lots of useful features
such as Lambda expressions, Streams API and Optionals. Lambda expressions are a short way of writing or applying functions to data, Streams API allows you to
use function...

2. Spring Boot (softly opiniated approach to handling many common problems)
