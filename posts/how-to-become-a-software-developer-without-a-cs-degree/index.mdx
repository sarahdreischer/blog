Becoming a Software Developer if you don't have a Computer Science degree can be confusing and time-intensive. But don't feel discouraged, there are several ways
to get your foot in the door. Some of the options are listed below:

1. Join a Coding Bootcamp - this will take about 14 weeks on average and can cost you anywhere between 7,000 and 20,000Â£.

2. Join a Company that would hire and train you without any prior coding knowledge.

3. Learn to code by yourself.

If you're lacking the time or resources to take up a Coding Bootcamp course and there is no job in sight that doesn't require you to be a professional developer,
then learning in your own time is always a great option.

I, myself, didn't study Computer Science in university and I have faced the problem not knowing how to best prepare for a career in Sotware Development. But in my
case I have been fortunate enough to be hired by a company that was willing to teach me all the skills needed for the job.

So if you would like to learn as much as you can by yourself but don't know where to start and are even confused about what to focus your time and energy on, here
are some of the languages, frameworks and tools that are used by many companies.

<h1>Front-End Development</h1>

So what is Front-End Development? Front-End developers create Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) such as websites, smartphone apps, web apps or basically any visualized
Software that a user can interact with.

A great way to start learning front-end development is by creating a website (which you won't need to host it publically, you can run websites locally on
your machine for practice). Why websites? It's simply because by learning these basic components, you will then be able to start learning frameworks such as React
with which you will be able to not only create websites but also phone applications (React.JS for web application and React Native for cross-platform smartphone apps) -
you're basically hitting two birds with one stone.

TODO - briefly explain HTML, CSS and Javascript

I found the following resources most useful to get started:

TODO - Also mention CSS and Bootstrap.

<h2>Angular and React.JS</h2>

**Angular and React.JS** are both Javascript frameworks for building web applications. These frameworks have gained much popularity over the recent years and are
skills that many employers look out for. If you don't have basic HTML knowledge feel free to read and try out some of the links below.

TODO - add HTML, CSS and Javascript links here

<h2>State Management Libraries</h2>

To become confident in using the frameworks above you should definitely learn about state management in both React and Angular as they will simplify the way you
deal with states in an application. If you are not sure what states are, then I hope this example will make it a little clearer.

Imagine you have a Sliding Banner component on your website. A reasonable state of the banner could be the current image it displays - let's say you call the state
_imageState_ and the first image is _image1.png_. After 3 seconds the imageState changes to image2.png which is reflected in the imageState variable.

States can also be used by several application components - for instance ...

If you have many states in different components of your web application and a single state might even need to be accessed and updated by several component then it
makes sense to neatly manage these states. The following two libraries are really good tools for state management.

<h3>Redux and NgRx</h3>

Redux is a state management library for React - it is also a design pattern that stores states of your application in a central place (e.g. a state could be that
a checkbox is currently checked or unchecked). NgRx is the Angular equivalent of Redux.

<h3>React Hooks</h3>

React has an inbuilt state management library which lets you define states within class components. A better way to work with states is to use React Hooks which allow
you to create state within a component or within a context provider that can be accessed by several components.

<h1>Back-End Technologies</h1>

<h2>Java 8</h2>

Java is always a good language to learn if you want to work as a Backend developer. It is used by 64,000 companies in the US alone and is the base language of
many newly written Software and legacy Software that is still being maintained. As a minimum I would suggest to learn Java 8 which contains lots of useful features
such as Lambda expressions, Streams API and Optionals. Lambda expressions are a short way of writing or applying functions to data, Streams API allows you to
use function...

<h2>Spring Boot</h2>

Spring Boot is a framework for Java Microservices (microservices are ...) and combines many features that are offered by the Spring framework. Spring framework
alleviates many problems a Backend developer faces, e.g. querying a database, security, creating Rest APIs etc. You can choose to use individual Spring framework
libraries that deal with an individual concern or you can wrap your application inside Spring Boot - Spring Boot comes out of the box with configurable features
that span the many concerns the Spring frameworks tries to alleviate, leading to the softly opinionated framework Spring Boot.

(softly opiniated approach to handling many common problems)

<h1>DevOps Tools</h1>

DevOps engineers deal with quickly creating qualitative applications that are deployed into production as fast as possible whilst ensuring the highest application
quality possible. Under DevOps there are many available tools. Here are some of popular tools that are used by companies.

<h2>Jenkins</h2>

<h2>Kubernetes</h2>
