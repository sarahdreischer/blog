<h1>Intro</h1>

<h1>How I became a Software Developer</h1>

I have become a Software Developer a year after graduating from university
at a large company without a background in Computer Science. I studied
Electronic Engineering which is somewhat related to CS, however I was only
able to do some basic Java and C programming which was nowhere near to what
professional Software Developers are doing. Post uni I have found myself in
various interviews at smaller companies which were looking for developers
but my lack of experience could not meet their requirements.

Eventually I had found a different job but my desire to work as a developer
still remained, so I was looking for several options to get my foot into the
door.

<h1>Ways to become a Software Developer</h1>

**_One of the possible options was to join a Coding Bootcamp which however
requires time and money - on average around 8 weeks and several thousand
pounds/ dollars (this was not an option for me as I had just graduated from
uni and gotten my first job, meaning I neither had plenty of money to spend on
a bootcamp nor the time)._**

**_And of course the second option was to take another masters (which again would
result in a time and money issue)._**

**_The third option was to teach myself all the relevant skills (but I didn't
know where to start or what skills companies really looked out for)._**

**_The fourth and final option was to join a Graduate Scheme position as a
developer at a large company that didn't require a background in Computer
Science - this is what led me to become a developer and over the first year I
have learned various full-stack technologies and I was able to write
production level code!!_**

So if you are in a remotely similar situation, meaning you want to become a
developer but are lacking industry specific skills and you neither have time,
money or the possibility to join a company as a developer that doesn't require
you to have any coding skills - then a good option is to learn as much as you
can on your own. This is why I have written this series for you and I would like
to share with you all the tips and resources I received to gain industry
relevant skills and become a professional developer. Hopefully you will be
able to learn good coding practices and gain common skills that are required
by many companies. This could bring you a step closer to becoming a
(professional) Software Developer.

  possible and the learning journey remains enjoyable.
