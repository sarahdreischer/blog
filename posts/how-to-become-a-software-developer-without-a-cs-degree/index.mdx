<h1>How I became a Software Developer</h1>

I have become a Software Developer a year after graduating from university
without a background in Computer Science. Post university I have found myself
in various interviews at smaller companies which were looking for developers
but my lack of experience could not meet their requirements.

Eventually I had found a different job but my desire to work as a developer
still remained, so I was looking for several options to get my foot into the
door.

<h1>Ways to become a Software Developer</h1>

These are the options that were available to me:

<h2>1. Join a Coding Bootcamp</h2>

Joining a Coding Bootcamp was not an option for me as it requires time and money -
on average around 8 weeks and several thousand pounds/ dollars. I could not afford
this option as a fresh University graduate who just had her first job.

<h2>2. Get a Degree in Computer Science</h2>

This is option didn't appeal to me either for the same reasons as above and due to
the fact that I already had a degree.

<h2>3. Teach yourself</h2>

Teaching myself all the relevant skills was a good option - however, I didnt' know where
to start and what languages, frameworks and engineering concepts are existent and relevant
to companies (keep reading this blog series to find out how you can learn in your own time).

<h2>
  4. Find a company that would hire without coding skills (e.g. Graduate Scheme)
</h2>

My final option was to join a Graduate Scheme position as a developer at a large company that
didn't require a background in Computer Science - this is what led me to become a developer
and over the first year I have learned various full-stack technologies and I was able to write
production level code!!

So if you are in a remotely similar situation, meaning you want to become a
developer but are lacking industry specific skills and you neither have time,
money or the possibility to join a company as a developer that doesn't require
you to have any coding skills - then a good option is to learn as much as you
can on your own.

This is why I have written this series for you and I would like to share with you
all the tips and resources I found most useful to gain industry relevant skills and
become a professional developer. Hopefully you will be able to learn good coding
practices and gain common skills that are required by many companies.

<h1>Frontend Technologies</h1>

Read more if you want to find about frontend technologies that are commonly used by companies.

1. Angular
2. React.JS
3. Redux or NgRx
4. Hooks

If you are a true beginner, you might ask yourself: What is all of this??

Angular and React.JS are both Javascript frameworks for building web apps - without useful
frameworks as such you would likely use a mixture between HTML, CSS and Javscript to create
a website or web app. The non-framework way would require you to write one webpage at a time
with all the static contents per page in a single file. Also you would not be able to share
common components between different pages of a website - e.g. a Navigation Bar without copy
and pasting the same code. Frameworks make your life much easier.

Redux is a React state management pattern where all data is kept at a central place within an
application. The same applies for NgRx - in fact NgRx is the Redux equivalent for Angular.
Redux was developed by Facebook.

<h1>Backend Technologies</h1>

_Refer to other blog posts that focus on each indivdual discipline_.

Read more if you want to find about backend technologies that are commonly used by companies.

1. Java (learn about Java 8 minimum and know about Lambdas etc.)
2. Spring Boot (softly opiniated approach to handling many common problems)
3. Databases
