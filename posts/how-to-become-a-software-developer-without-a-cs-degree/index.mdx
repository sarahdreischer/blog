Becoming a Software Developer if you don't have a Computer Science degree can be confusing and time-intensive. You could join a Coding Bootcamp or a company
that would hire and train you without any prior coding knowledge. But if you're lacking the time or resources to take up a Coding Bootcamp course and there's no
job in sight which doesn't require you to be a professional developer already, then learning in your own time is always a great option.

As someone who didn't study Computer Science I have been in a very similar situation - only knowing basic Java and HTML but I have been fortunate enough to be
hired by a company that was willing to teach me all the skills needed for the job.

So here are some of the languages, frameworks and tools that I have learned
to use in my first Software Development job that are used by many companies and can help you prepare for your first job.

<h1>Frontend Technologies</h1>

<h2>Angular and React.JS</h2>

Angular and React.JS are both Javascript frameworks for building web applications. Both frameworks have gained much popularity over the recent years and are
skills that many employers look out for.

<h2>Redux and NgRx</h2>

Redux is a state management library for React - it is a design pattern that stores all states of your application in a central place (e.g. a state could be that
a checkbox is currently checked or unchecked). NgRx is the Angular equivalent of Redux.

<h2>React Hooks</h2>

React Hooks is a library in React - as the name implies. Like Redux and NgRx it is a state management library, however, Hooks can define state in a component.
Lets say you have a React component that only displays and manages a Banner on your website. The current image state of the Banner could be that it displays Image 1.
Later the image state changes to Image 2. Other components of your web application such as the Navigation Bar component don't care about the Image state of
the Banner component - therefore, it makes sense that the Banner Image state only belongs to the Banner Component and the Layout Component cannot access this state.
This is possible using Hooks.
