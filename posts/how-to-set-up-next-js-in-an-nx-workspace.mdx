Nx is a great toolkit for monorepos encompassing many tools, and out-of-the-box configurations,
such as Typescript, ESLint, TSConfig, Webpack as well as well-known plugins and frameworks such as React,
Angular, Next.JS, Express etc. Within an NX monorepo you can for example create a React app and an Express
API app that are both sharing a common library. This makes your applications more coherent and compatible.

## Set-Up an Nx workspace

To get started open your terminal. If you haven't already installed Npx install it using the following
command:

<code>npm install -g npx </code>

To create the workspace run the following command:

<code>npx create-nx-workspace</code>

Now you can name your workspace, choose your application type and name your application:

      1. Enter your workspace name: your_workspace_name
      2. Choose Next.JS to crate the new workspace
      3. Name th Next.JS application: your_app_name
      4. Choose your stylesheet format (e.g. CSS, SASS)

To start your Next project, from the terminal go inside the new workspace directory and type in
`npm run start` or `yarn run start` (depending on the package manager used). Note: If you get the
`Browserslist: caniuse-lite is outdated.` error, run `npm update`.

Now you should be able to access your page on `localhost:4200`.

To build your application, run `npm run build` or `yarn run build`. This will add your built
application to the `dist/apps/your_app_name` direcotry.

To run the prod build add the following script to your package.json file:

<code>"prod": "next start dist/apps/your_app_name"</code>

Now you can call <code>npm run prod</code> to test the prod build from localhost:3000 by default.
