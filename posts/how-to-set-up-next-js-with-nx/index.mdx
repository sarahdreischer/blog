Nx is a great toolkit for monorepos that comes with many tools, configurations and plugins out-of-the-box
such as Typescript, ESLint, TSConfig, Webpack and well-known frameworks such as React, Angular, Next.JS, Express.
The advantage of monorepos is that you can create scalable applications with interdependencies, e.g. you can have a
Next.JS app and an Express Api server which are both sharing a common library. This makes your applications more coherent
and compatible.

**Note:** In this tutorial I will be using the NPM package manager as opposed to Yarn. If you're using Yarn,
simply replace **npm** with **yarn** for the command used here.

# 1. Set-Up Nx

To set up your workspace run the command(s) below:

```bash
npm install -g npx # skip this if you've already installed npx
npx create-nx-workspace

## You will be asked to answer similar questions to the ones below
# Enter your workspace name: your_workspace_name
# Choose Next.JS to crate the new workspace
# Name th Next.JS application: your_app_name
# Choose your stylesheet format (e.g. CSS, SASS)
```

Congrats! After a few minutes your workspace should be set up and you can continue building your application.

# 2. Serve and Build your Next.JS App

To start your Next project, from the terminal go inside the workspace directory and run the following command:

```bash
npm run start
```

You should then be able to access your page on **_localhost:4200_**.

To build your application, run `npm run build` which will automatically add the build files and direcotries inside
the `dist/apps/your_app_name` directory.

##### Serve the prod build

Before deployment you'll likely want to test the prod build locally first. You can either run `next start` from the
`dist/apps/your_app_name` directory or alternatively you can add the following script to your package.json file:

`"prod": "next start dist/apps/your_app_name"`

This will allow you to call `npm run prod` from the workspace root directory and if everything went well you can visit the prod build
on localhost:3000.

# 3. Deploy to Vercel
