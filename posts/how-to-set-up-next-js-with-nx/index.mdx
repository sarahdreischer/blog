Nx is a great toolkit for monorepos and is packaged with many useful tools, configurations and plugins such as ESLint and TSConfig.
It also supports several frameworks such as React, Angular and Next.JS. The advantage of monorepos over a single repo per application is
that you can better develop scalable applications that are sharing common libraries and data models or are interdependent on each other in general.

**Note:** In this tutorial I will be using NPM as the preferred package manager. If you're using Yarn, simply replace **npm** with **yarn** in the commands.

# 1. Set-Up Nx

To set up your workspace run the command(s) below (you may skip the first command if you already have npx installed):

```bash
npm install -g npx
npx create-nx-workspace
```

You will then be prompted to configure your workspace and first application. From the available options choose the Next.JS plugin.

# 2. Serve and Build your Next.JS App

To serve your Next.JS project, execute the following command within the workspace root directory:

```bash
npm run start
```

By default the web page will be accessible from **localhost:4200**.

To build your application, run `npm run build` which will automatically add the compiled files and directories inside
the `dist/apps/your_app_name` directory.

## Serve the prod build

Before deployment you'll likely want to serve the compiled files locally first. You can either run `next start` inside the
`dist/apps/your_app_name` directory or alternatively add the following script to your package.json file:

```json
"prod": "next start dist/apps/your_app_name"
```

This will allow you to call `npm run prod` from the workspace root directory and make the production web page available on **_localhost:3000_**.

# 3. Deploy to Vercel

You can now sign up for a free account on <a href="https://wwww.vercel.com">Vercel.com</a> to deploy and host your application.
In order for Vercel to deploy a Next.JS application embedded into an Nx workspace, you must configure the pipeline to access the compiled files
from the `./dist/apps/your_app_name/.next` directory.

**Note:** You must include **./next** as part of your Output Directory path, as Vercel will not recognize the parent directory as a Next.JS application.
Vercel would throw the <i><b>routes-manifest.json could not be found</b></i> error.

</div>

Now click deploy and _Voila_ your application is live!
