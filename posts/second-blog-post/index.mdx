<personal>
  I have become a Software Developer at 23 without a background in Computer
  Science. I studied Electrical and Electronic Engineering which is somewhat
  related to CS however I was only able to do some basic Java and C programming
  coming out of uni which was nowhere near to what professional Software
  Developers are doing.
</personal>

<personal>
  So I have thankfully had the chance to become a graduate at a big company that
  didn't require a background in Computer Science and over a year I have learned
  various full-stack technologies and I am now able to write production level
  code.
</personal>

<personal>
  With this post I am hoping to share with you what I found most useful on my
  learning journey and hopefully you will be able to learn good coding practices
  through this series which could bring you a step closer to becoming a
  professional Software Developer.
</personal>

<personal>
  Purpose of this is for you to become as little overwhelmed as possible so that
  the learning journey remains enjoyable.
